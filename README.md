# Front End Client for MSUSF

## Motivation for the Project
The purpose of this project is to create an easier way for students and researchers with nontechnical backgrounds to access geospatial data. With the help of the Economics department at the University of San Francisco, a team of developers at Make School built a web application that produces CSV files of different datasets from Google Earth Engine and the web. Users can download the CSV files and utilize them for research purposes without worrying about the programming aspect.
